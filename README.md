##Project Description
Planur v2, the evolved version of the original Planur app, is designed to revolutionize travel planning. This iteration enhances the user experience, offering a streamlined, intuitive interface for managing trip itineraries. Leveraging modern technologies like Next.js, React, MongoDB, Mongoose, SupabaseAuth, Tailwind, and Node.js, Planur v2 provides a cohesive, responsive platform for trip organization.

The backend utilizes Next.js's integrated App Router for all HTTP requests and navigation, including being able to make requests to MongoDB. This iteration is now enriched with Supabase's Auth capabilities for secure access. Deployment is handled seamlessly through Vercel.

Running Planur v2 locally is straightforward, requiring minimal setup. This ensures that developers can easily contribute to or adapt the project for their needs.
